This is Borrow Me! 

A chrome extension which automatically checka the availability of Goodreads books at the Calgary Public Library. 
Spoiler! Most of the time they are not available, but this extension is meant to make the treasure hunt for your next book easier. 

I created this extension to solve a problem that I was having with Goodreads, it seemed like all the books I was interested in were always unavailable ( like 4 month wait unavailable) once I switched tabs to CPL.
In order to reduce the time spent looking for a book, and increase the time I spent reading it I created Borrow Me.
